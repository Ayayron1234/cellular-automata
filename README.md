- SDL library for graphics rendering
## Usage
The program integrates ImGui for a user-friendly interface, making it easy to adjust visualization parameters on the fly. Compile the provided source code with a C++ compiler supporting CUDA.

Explore the Mandelbrot and Julia sets with intuitive mouse interactions. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out dynamically, focusing on the area pointed to by the cursor. This allows for precise navigation within the fractal space.

**Note:** Due to the limitations of floating-point precision, extremely deep zoom levels may lead to numerical instability and visual artifacts.

Utilize the *Properties* window to control various aspects of the fractal visualization:
- **Switch between Mandelbrot and Julia sets** using the radio buttons in the *Type* section of the window.
- **Adjust maximum iterations at zoom 1.0:** Locate a setting in the ImGui window that enables you to modify the maximum iterations used in the algorithm when the zoom level is at 1.0. This parameter influences the level of detail visible in the fractal at the default zoom.
- **Control Iteration Count Increase with Zoom:** The field in the *Iteration increase falloff* section allows you to adjust how quickly the iteration count increases as you zoom in. This parameter governs the refinement of details as you zoom into the fractal, offering a balance between performance and visual intricacy.

## Implementation
### Fractals
The Mandelbrot set is a captivating mathematical fractal defined through the iterative process $$z_{n+1}=z_n^2+c$$, where $c$ is a complex constant. Its visual representation exhibits intricate, self-replicating patterns in the complex plane. The Julia set, intimately linked to the Mandelbrot set, explores variations of this equation by considering different values of $c$, unveiling a diverse range of captivating visualizations within the broader Mandelbrot framework.

```cpp
int iter = 0;
Float xtemp = 0;
while ((z.x * z.x + z.y * z.y <= 4.0f) && (iter < maxIterations)) {
	xtemp = z.x * z.x - z.y * z.y + c.x;
	z.y = 2.0f * z.x * z.y + c.y;
	z.x = xtemp;
	iter++;
}
```

This code snippet represents the iterative calculation in the Mandelbrot set.
The loop continues as long as the magnitude of $z$ remains within a specified range and the iteration count is below a maximum threshold. In the Mandelbrot set, points where $z$ stays within this range are part of the set, contributing to the formation of the fractal patterns.

### CUDA
CUDA is crucial in this project because it enables parallel processing on NVIDIA GPUs, significantly accelerating the computation of complex mathematical operations involved in generating Mandelbrot and Julia sets. By harnessing the parallel architecture of GPUs, CUDA enhances the program's performance, allowing for real-time rendering and interactive exploration of fractal patterns.

```cpp
int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
int i = row * options.windowWidth + col;

Float wph = windowWidth / windowHeight;
Float x0 = (col / windowWidth) / zoom - (0.5 / zoom) - position.x;
Float y0 = ((row / windowHeight) / zoom - (0.5 / camera.zoom) - position.y) / wph;
```

This code computes the 2D grid coordinates (row, col) based on the CUDA thread indices and block indices. It then calculates the 1D array index (i) corresponding to a pixel in the image. The subsequent lines compute normalized coordinates (x0, y0) within the specified window, considering zoom and camera position adjustments, ensuring accurate mapping of the pixel's position in the fractal space.
